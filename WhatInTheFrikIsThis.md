# What is it?
This is a personal repository holding a Readme.md file. On github, you can create a repository called the same as your username and the Readme file inside of it will be dispayed on your profile.

# What are metrics?
I used [github metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics) inside my readme in order to show more about what I do. It uses github actions to update an svg that is embeded in my Readme every hour using `[{cron: "*0 * * * *"}]` in order to not get ratelimited by [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). The settings for my metrics can be found below and for more information about how to set them up, click [here](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/blob/master/README.md#%EF%B8%8F-using-github-action-on-your-profile-repository-5-min-setup). For more information about cron schedules, click [here](https://jasonet.co/posts/scheduled-actions/).

#### Discaimer: I am in no ways associated with lowligher or Github Metrics. I just hope this document can help someone out. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
